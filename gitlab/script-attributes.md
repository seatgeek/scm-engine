## `webhook_event`

!!! tip "`webhook_event` attribute is only available in `server` mode"

    See the [GitLab Webhook Events documentation](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/integrations/webhook_events.html) for available fields.

    The attributes are named _exactly_ as documented in the GitLab documentation.

- [`Comments`](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/integrations/webhook_events.html#comment-events) - A comment is made or edited on an issue or merge request.
- [`Merge request events`](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/integrations/webhook_events.html#merge-request-events) - A merge request is created, updated, or merged.
